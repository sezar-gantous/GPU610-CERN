This directory contains some sort of a test suite.
Just call the run_test and see it working.
If everything went fine, you wont see any (real) output from diff
If you see output from diff or error messages, there are most likely some problems
There could be some difference because of floating point operations,
which are done in random order in the parallel code. This should only affect a not
significant part of the result like: "3.113734e-06" instead of "3.113739e-06"

Explanations:
run_test will first clean up previous stuff
then it will call the drive binary in the current directory
then it will diff the results to some given results

Updates (what to change if something has to be updated or changed):
-server
edit run_test

-drive source
copy to this directory with the correct file name
source the icc:
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/IntelSoftware/linux/all-setup.csh ia32
compile with:
make
if different file name, edit Makefile and run_test

-new output to compare against
rename orig/ to orig_somehelpfulname/
create orig/
put new expected output in orig/

-path
change run_test (multiple lines)
change DrivingTerms in workdir
